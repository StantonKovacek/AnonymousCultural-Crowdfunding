# Anonymous Cultural Crowdfunding - 1 Minute Video Script

## Video Script Dialogue

Good morning. I'm showcasing the Anonymous Cultural Crowdfunding platform, a comprehensive FHEVM example hub built for the Zama Bounty Track.

This project demonstrates privacy-preserving smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Imagine a crowdfunding platform where donation amounts stay completely encrypted, and project creators never see individual contribution values. That's what we've built here.

The platform includes eleven smart contracts covering everything from basic encryption to advanced access control patterns. We have over thirty-six test cases with detailed learning markers, and more than forty-five hundred lines of comprehensive documentation.

Let me show you the key features. First, the main application handles project creation, anonymous contributions, automated finalization, and secure fund distribution. Contributors can support cultural projects without revealing donation amounts.

We also provide ten educational examples teaching FHE concepts: single and multiple value encryption, user and public decryption patterns, arithmetic and comparison operations, access control implementation, and common anti-patterns to avoid.

The automation scripts are particularly powerful. You can generate standalone FHEVM example repositories with a single command. Create category-based projects for learning paths. Auto-generate GitBook documentation directly from code comments.

Everything is production-ready with full CI/CD integration, comprehensive testing, linting, and Etherscan verification support.

This is privacy-preserving blockchain development made accessible, educational, and practical. Thank you.

## Alternative Shorter Dialogue (45 seconds)

If you need a more concise version:

"Anonymous Cultural Crowdfunding brings privacy to blockchain fundraising using Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Donation amounts stay encrypted throughout the entire process. Creators never see individual contribution values, ensuring complete privacy.

This FHEVM example hub includes eleven smart contracts demonstrating encryption, decryption, arithmetic operations, and access control patterns. Over thirty-six test cases provide comprehensive learning resources. Our three automation scripts let you generate standalone FHEVM projects with one command.

The platform is production-ready with full testing coverage, CI/CD integration, and extensive documentation. Whether you're building privacy-preserving applications or learning FHE concepts, this project provides everything needed to get started.

Visit our repository and join the privacy-preserving blockchain revolution."
